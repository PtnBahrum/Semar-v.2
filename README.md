# Semar-v.2

The Semar V.2 application is an application that introduces wayang cultural heritage to the younger generation, especially elementary, junior high, and high school students. Semar V.2 is a development of the previous application, Semar-App. This application provides information about shadow puppet characters, videos of puppet shows, and puppet learning materials. In addition, this application is also equipped with a quiz feature to test the level of knowledge about puppet material of a student and also a scanner feature that makes it easier for students to find the name of a puppet character just by sending a picture of the puppet.
